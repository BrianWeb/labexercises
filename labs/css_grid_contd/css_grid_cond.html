                    Test Your Knowledge</h1>
                <h2>CSS Grid Layout Realworld Example</h2>
            </header>
            <p>This lab tests your knowledge of lab 3 where we created a responsive image gallery. </p>
            <p>Will we revise how to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Create a responsive website layout using CSS Grid.</li>
                <li>Use media queries to adjust layouts for different screen sizes.</li>
                <li>Work with percentages for flexible, proportional columns.</li>
                <li>Design a simple single-column mobile view and a two-column desktop view.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Auto vs Percentages in CSS Grid</h3>

            <p>
                In the previous lab, we used the <span class="highlight">auto</span> keyword
                (and combinations like <span class="highlight">auto auto auto</span>)
                to size grid columns. The <span class="highlight">auto</span> setting tells the browser:
                <em>“Make this column as wide as its content needs, but no more.”</em>
                This approach is quick, flexible, and content-driven.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, in this lab, we’ll move to <strong>percentages</strong>
                (e.g., <span class="highlight">30% 70%</span>).
                This method sizes columns relative to the available space in the grid container,
                no matter what content goes inside. In other cases you might want to have gaps and spaces so using 25% for the first column and 75% for the second column can be effective.
            </p>

            <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>

            <h4>Using <span class="highlight">auto</span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to use, adapts naturally to content. Great for layouts where
                    you don’t know or don’t want to specify exact proportions.</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Columns can become uneven if content sizes vary greatly. Less
                    control over consistent proportions across screen widths.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Using Percentages</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Precise control over layout proportions. Scales smoothly with
                    viewport changes, perfect for responsive design.</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires careful planning so percentages add up correctly. Can feel
                    rigid if content overflows the allocated space.</li>
            </ul>
            <article>
                <h3>Best Practices with Percentages</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure your percentages add up to 100% (or less, if you want gaps).</li>
                    <li>Use media queries to adjust percentages for different screen sizes.</li>

                </ul>

                    <h2>Requirements</h2>
                    <p>Use CSS Grid to create a responsive layout that adjusts based on the viewport size.</p>
                    <p>
                        For mobile (default) → the layout is 1 column.</p>

                    <p>For screens larger than 599px → we want two columns:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First column = 30% (sidebar)</li>

                        <li>Second column = 70% (main content)</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>Use media queries to change the layout at the 600px breakpoint.</p>

                    <p>Reminder: A 'viewport' is the user's visible area of a web page, which is determined by the size
                        of
                        the
                        browser
                        window.

                    <h3>Tips</h3>

                    <p>Everything you need to know is in our previous labwork on Responsive CSS Grid Layouts. </p>
                    <p>Remember to test your layouts at each breakpoint to ensure they are working as expected.</p>
                    <p>Notice how it is hard to get the text box and the image to align where they are the same height?
                        One solution is to use the CSS Flexbox, which we will look at in your next lab.</p>
