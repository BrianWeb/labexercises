            <p>Recap: A 'viewport' is the user's visible area of a web page, which is determined by the size of the
                browser
                window.

            <h2>Lab Exercise</h2>
            <p>Recreate the image gallery from the screenshots above. You don't need to create the navbar, side menu,
                footer or any other elements besides the car photo gallery and accompanying text. Use a responsive CSS
                grid layout with media queries. You can use placeholder images
                from any source.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>For the mobile viewport, create a single column layout with each car image and <b>text to the righthand side</b>
                    taking up the full width of
                    the viewport.</li>
                <li>For the tablet viewport, create a two column layout with each car image and <b>text underneath</b> taking
                    up 50% of the width of
                    the viewport.</li>
                <li>For the desktop/laptop viewport, create a three column layout with each car image and <b>text
                    underneath</b> taking up 33.33%
                    of the width of the viewport.</li>
                <li>Add some spacing between the images using grid-gap or padding/margin.</li>
                <li>Use the following breakpoints for your media queries:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mobile: 0 - 599px</li>
                    <li>Tablet: 600 - 899px</li>
                    <li>Desktop: 900px and above</li>
                    
                </ul>
                <p>Recap: A 'breakpoint' is a specific point in the CSS where the layout changes based on the viewport size. <br>See notes on responsive design for more information.</p> 
                
                <li>Include at least 6 car images with accompanying text (car name and price) below each image.</li>
                <li>Add a title above the gallery that says "Classic and Sports Car Gallery".</li>
                <li>Add a short description below the title that says "A selection of classic and sports cars available
                    for sale."</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Tip: Usually we start with a mobile first approach but seeing as in our last lab covered how to create
                the above layouts for tablets and computers, you can use that knowledge to create your initial layouts
                and make them responsive. Once that is done, you can think about how to create the mobile layout.</p>
               
                <p>Everything you need to know is in our previous labwork on Responsive CSS Grid Layouts. The main difference is the approach to styling for different screen sizes, and how to implement the text to the right hand side for mobile viewports</p>
                 <p>Remember to test your layouts at each breakpoint to ensure they are working as expected.</p>
