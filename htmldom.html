        <h1>The HTML Document Tree</h1>

        <p>Each HTML document can actually be referred to as a document tree. We describe the elements in the tree like
            we
            would describe a family tree. There are ancestors, descendants, parents, children and siblings.</p>

        <p>It is important to understand the document tree because CSS selectors use the document tree.</p>

        <p>Use the sample HTML document below for these examples. The &lt;head&gt; section of the document is omitted
            for brevity.
        </p>

        <p>A diagram of the above HTML document tree would look like this.</p>

        <h2 id="ancestor">Ancestor</h2>
        <p>An ancestor refers to any element that is connected but further up the document tree - no matter how many
            levels higher.</p>
        <p>In the diagram below, the &lt;body> element is the ancestor of all other elements on the page.</p>

        <p><img src="images/htmldom/dom_tree_ancestor.gif" alt="alt" /></p>


        <h2 id="descendant">Descendant</h2>
        A descendant refers to any element that is connected but lower down the document tree - no matter how many
        levels lower.</p>
        <p>In the diagram below, all elements that are connected below the &lt;div&gt; element are descendants of that
            &lt;div&gt;.

        <p><img src="images/htmldom/dom_tree_descendant.gif" alt="alt" /></p>


        <h2 id="parent_and_child">Parent and Child</h2>
        <p>A parent is an element that is directly above and connected to an element in the document tree. In the
            diagram below, the &lt;div&gt; is a parent to the &lt;ul&gt;.</p>

        <p>A child is an element that is directly below and connected to an element in the document tree. In the diagram
            above, the &lt;ul&gt; is a child to the &lt;div&gt;.</p>

        <p><img src="images/htmldom/dom_tree_parent.gif" alt="alt" /></p>



        <h2 id="sibling">Sibling</h2>
        <p>A sibling is an element that shares the same parent with another element. </p>
        <p>In the diagram below, the &lt;li&gt;&#x27;s are siblings as they all share the same parent - the &lt;ul&gt;.
        </p>
