            <p>Recap: A 'viewport' is the user's visible area of a web page, which is determined by the size of the
                browser
                window.

            <h2>Lab Exercise</h2>
            <p>Recreate the image gallery from the screenshots above. You don't need to create the navbar, side menu,
                footer or any other elements besides the car photo gallery and accompanying text. Use a responsive CSS
                grid layout with media queries. You can use placeholder images
                from any source.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>For the mobile viewport, create a single column layout with each car image and <b>text to the righthand side</b>
                    taking up the full width of the viewport. Create this using a Flexbox.</li>
                <li>For the tablet viewport, create a two column layout with each car image and <b>text underneath</b>
                    taking up 50% of the width of the viewport. Create this using a CSS Grid. Inside the first grid item, place the Flexbox container created in task 1. </li>
                <li>For the desktop/laptop viewport, create a three column layout with each car image and <b>text underneath</b>
                    taking up 33.33% of the width of the viewport.</li>
                <li>Add some spacing between the images using grid-gap or padding/margin.</li>
                <li>Use the following breakpoints for your media queries:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mobile: 0 - 599px</li>
                    <li>Tablet: 600 - 899px</li>
                    <li>Desktop: 900px and above</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Recap: A 'breakpoint' is a specific point in the CSS where the layout changes based on the viewport size. See notes on responsive design for more information.</p>

                <li>Include at least 6 car images with accompanying text (car name and price) below each image.</li>
                <li>Add a title above the gallery that says "Classic and Sports Car Gallery".</li>
                <li>Add a short description below the title that says "A selection of classic and sports cars available
                    for sale."</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Tips</h3>

            <p>Everything you need to know is in our previous labwork on Responsive CSS Grid Layouts. The main
                difference is the approach to styling for different screen sizes, and how to implement the text to
                the right hand side for mobile viewports. However instead of percentages, you could use fractions. See below.</p>
            <p>Remember to test your layouts at each breakpoint to ensure they are working as expected.</p>

            <h1>The <code>fr</code> Unit</h1>
            <p>
                The <code>fr</code> unit is a fractional unit, an input that automatically calculates layout
                divisions when adjusting for gaps inside the grid.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Points</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The <code>fr</code> unit allows you to define grid tracks as fractions of the available space.</li>
                <li>If a grid container has 4 columns with <code>1fr</code> each, they will each take up an equal amount of space (25% each).</li>
                <li>Using different fractional values allows for varied column sizes within the same grid.</li>
            </ul>
